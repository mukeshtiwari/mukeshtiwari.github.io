Abstract
--------
We introduce a formal, modular framework that captures a large number of different instances of the Single Transferable Vote (STV) counting scheme in a uniform way. The framework requires that each instance defines the precise mechanism of counting and transferring ballots, electing and eliminating candidates. From formal proofs of basic sanity conditions for each mechanism inside the Coq theorem prover, we then synthesise code that implements the given scheme in a provably correct way and produces a universally verifiable certificate of the count. We have applied this to various variations of STV, including several used in Australian parliamentary elections and demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by means of real-world case studies.
